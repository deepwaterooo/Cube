* Cube
- for Java programming course project. 
- compiled, and works, just the readering is NOT what I expected. will modify texture rendering, and picked triangle color to be yellow. 
- As the starting point for the course project (to integrate gestures, music etc), & starting point for android opengl es. will need to fully understand the code. 
- Current starting point turnning cube video was put at search *youtube deepwaterooo wang*
- Will update "Undertable" repository first, then come back to fully understand the base codes for this project.
