- for Java programming course project. 
- compiled, and works, just the readering is NOT what I expected. will modify texture rendering, and picked triangle color to be yellow. 
- As the starting point for the course project (to integrate gestures, music etc), & starting point for android opengl es. will need to fully understand the code.
